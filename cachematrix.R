## makeCacheMatrix.R function receives a matrix as an argument and has 4 nested functions to set and get the matrix and its inverse
## It uses special assignment operator <<- to cache values in variables in the parent environment
## This helps to reduce the calculations for costly operations like inverse of matrix and value is instead taken from the cache

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL   
        
        set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y      
        inv <<- NULL 
        }
        
        get <- function() x  
        setinv <- function(solve) inv <<- solve 
        getinv <- function() inv

# following code assigns above functions as named elements of list and returns it to the parent environment
        
        list(set = set, get = get,
        setinv = setinv,
        getinv = getinv)
}


## cacheSolve function accepts a matrix of type makeCacheMatrix and returns a matrix that is inverse of it
## if the inverse exists in cache it is picked from there
## else the inverse of matrix is calculated using solve function of R
## setinv() function is used to set the inverse in the input object

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

        inv <- x$getinv()
 
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
        }

        data <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinv(inv)
        inv
        }

# TO CHECK
# matrix1<-matrix(2:5, nrow=2, ncol=2)
# amatrix1<-makeCacheMatrix(matrix1)
# amatrix1$get()
# amatrix1$getinv()
# cacheSolve(amatrix1)
# amatrix1$getinv()
# cacheSolve(amatrix1) -- gets cached data
